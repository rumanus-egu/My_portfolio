# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Bike Rental Prediction](https://github.com/rumanus-egu/Bike-Rental-Prediction)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**94%** accuracy](https://github.com/rumanus-egu/Linear-Regression-Project/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Prediction of orthopaedic patients in normal and abnormal](https://github.com/rumanus-egu/Prediction-of-orthopaedic-patients-in-normal-and-abnormal-)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification wheather an orthopaedic patient is normal or abnormal for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/rumanus-egu/Knn_Nb_Project/blob/main/Knn_Nb_Project.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify an orthopaedic patient is normal or abnormalbased on various attributes
- Classified normal or abnormal by studying patterns in measured attributes of those orthopaedic data
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Bank data](https://github.com/rumanus-egu/Logistic-Regression-Project/blob/main/6_Logistic_Regression_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/bank image.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/rumanus-egu/Logistic-Regression-Project/blob/main/6_Logistic_Regression_Project.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Employee-Compensation](https://github.com/rumanus-egu/K_Means-Project/blob/main/K_Means_Project_2.ipynb)

<img src="images/EC.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Clustering, Elbow

**Project Objective:** The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits, paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013.This data is summarized and presented on the Employee-Compensation.

- Used K-Means algorythm to create cluster depending on the dataset.
- Used Elbow method to get the optimal number of cluster.
- Explored a Unsupervised Learning approach to create data group.

[Hand Written Digit Recognisation](https://github.com/rumanus-egu/DNN_Project/blob/main/step5_1_hand_writting_recognition_project.ipynb)

<img src="images/HD.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**98%** using **10** epochs]https://github.com/rumanus-egu/DNN_Project/blob/main/step5_1_hand_writting_recognition_project.ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Data Source: MNIST
- Trained Model with 10 epochs.
